	<h2>About this site</h2>
	<p>This is a version that only uses Eleventy – there's no React. It's pulling content from a WordPress GraphQL endpoint. It makes a page for each article and dumps the HTML into a div. There's no markup processing happening.</p>
	<p>Note that here images are being included – they're hotlinking to the original WordPress install. We could pretty easily be pulling these in.</p>
	<p>Other versions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://flax-kotahi-demo-gatsby.netlify.app">Gatsby version</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://flax-kotahi-demo-next.netlify.app">Next.js version</a></li>
	</ul>
